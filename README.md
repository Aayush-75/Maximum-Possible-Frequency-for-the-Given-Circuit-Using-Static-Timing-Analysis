This paper presents an in-depth investigation of static timing analysis (STA) applied to digital circuits for determining the maximum operating frequency. We explore key timing parameters such as propagation delay, setup and hold times, and critical path determination. A Python-based approach is used to automate the STA process by analyzing digital netlists. The methodology includes recursive path tracing and delay computation to identify bottlenecks. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings, with our test circuit achieving a maximum frequency of 0.0435 Hz.
